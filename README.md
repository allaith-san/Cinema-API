## TODO
### Future Improvements (Version 1.1)
If this were a full-fledged project and I had more time, here are some enhancements I would implement:

- Separate Date and Time: Make date and time more readable in movies and screenings.
- Use Real Data: Replace dummy data with real data from external APIs that support large volumes of requests.
- Enhanced Ticket Acquisition Process: Develop a more secure ticket purchasing process.
- Replace Placeholder Tokens: Use actual tokens instead of placeholder customer tokens.
- Ticket Scanning Detection System: Implement a system to detect whether tickets have been scanned.
- Cinema Management System: Ensure no two movies are playing in the same hall simultaneously, requiring a full management system beyond the current scope.
- Full Hall Handling: Address the issue of what happens when a hall is full, linking back to the need for a comprehensive management system rather than a quick API.
